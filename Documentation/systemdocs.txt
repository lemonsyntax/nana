ABSTRACT
This project develops a deep feedforward neural network model to predict student performance, leveraging academic records, demographics, and behavioral data. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and is optimized through hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner. The system provides accurate predictions and supports educators in identifying at-risk students, thereby improving educational outcomes.


CHAPTER ONE (Research Project Proposal)
1.0 Introduction
Predicting student performance is a vital component of modern educational technology, driven by the need to enhance academic outcomes and support student success. Traditional approaches often rely on basic statistical methods that may not capture the full complexity of factors influencing student performance. Neural networks present a sophisticated alternative capable of analyzing and interpreting intricate patterns within diverse datasets. This research focuses on developing an advanced predictive model using a deep feedforward neural network to assess and forecast student performance, using academic records, demographic information, and behavioral patterns.

The subject of this study is predicting student performance using deep neural networks. The field of study is machine learning, focusing on advanced neural network models to analyze and forecast academic outcomes based on student data.

1.2 Problem Statement
Accurate prediction of student performance is challenging due to the complex and multifaceted nature of academic outcomes. Traditional models often fall short in capturing these complexities. This project addresses these issues by employing a deep neural network, which can better analyze intricate patterns in student data. Hyperparameter tuning is used to further optimize model performance.
